# Installation

## Installation with Docker

## Installation with Docker (SQLite)

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  podfetch:
    image: samuel19982/podfetch:latest
    user: ${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}
    ports:
      - "80:8000"
    volumes:
      - podfetch-podcasts:/app/podcasts
      - podfetch-db:/app/db
    environment:
      - POLLING_INTERVAL=60
      - SERVER_URL=http://localhost:80
      - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app/db/podcast.db

volumes:
    podfetch-podcasts:
    podfetch-db:
```

It is important to change `UID` and `GID` to your user id and group id so that the files are owned by you and not by root.
Docker will create the volumes by default as root and podfetch will not be able to write to them.

## Installation with Docker (Postgres)

To use postgres you need to set the following environment variables:

```yaml
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/podfetch
```


## Installation without Docker

- Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/SamTV12345/PodFetch/releases)
- Create a shell script that sets the above environment variables and starts the podfetch binary
- Make the shell script executable
- Run the shell script
