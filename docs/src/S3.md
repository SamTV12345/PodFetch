# S3 configuration

So you want to use an S3 compatible storage backend to e.g. host files central or save costs for storage provisioning in the cloud? PodFetch now also supports S3 configuration.
This is also valuable if you want to use a self-hosted MinIO instance and don't want to map and mount volumes around. 
It is currently necessary that you have your files in S3 configured readonly so people can stream them from there.
