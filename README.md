# Podfetch

Podfetch is a self-hosted podcast manager. 
It is a web app that lets you download podcasts and listen to them online.
It is written in Rust and uses React for the frontend.

Every time a new commit is pushed to the main branch, a new docker image is built and pushed to docker hub. So it is best to use something like [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) to automatically update the docker image.

# Known issues

The podcast listening tool contains an advanced audio player that can be used to listen to your podcasts,skip episodes, turn the volumes as high as 300% or skip around in the current episode.

# Continue right where you stopped

The tool will automatically save your progress in the current episode and will resume from where you left off even if you close the browser. 
You can continue listening on all devices by just hitting play on any episode on your home screen.

## Internationalization
Podfetch is currently available in English and German. If you want to add a new language you can do so by adding a new file to the `i18n` folder and adding the translations to the file.

# RSS feed

Podfetch offers an own feed to download podcast episodes. You can add the url <SERVER_URL>/rss to your favorite podcast app like gPodder to download and play episodes.

# Podcast Index

It is also possible to retrieve/add podcasts from [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/).
To configure it you need to create an account on that website. After creating an account an email is sent to you with the required credentials.


| Variable            | Description                           | Default |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|
| PODINDEX_API_KEY    | the API key sent to you via mail      | %       |
| PODINDEX_API_SECRET | the API secret also found in the mail | %       |

* % means an empty string is configured as default

After successful setup you should see on the settings page a green checkmark next to the Podindex config section.
